Used to maintain requested features or future work.

- "offset" in the regex type, does it mean lines or bytes?
- maybe compile the magic file into a serialized compressed file for size reasons?
	- at least pre-process it to normalize whitespace
- need to handle the indirect type?
- need more tests on floating point numbers, find magics that use them
- is the quad date in seconds or millis?? find a magic that uses them

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speed improvements:

- categorize the file as ~ascii or not, only run the search and regex on the ascii files
	- maybe process the file by lines and search each rule instead of having each rule search the file
- for the binary types, return the starting offset and starting byte (watch network byte order)
	- then walk the first X bytes and only call the rules if they have the appropriate starting byte
	- all other rules then in an "other" rule list
	- try to get down to as few rules in the "other" list
