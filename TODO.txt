- Need to handle:
	macintosh:>0x402          beldate-0x7C25B080      x               created: %s,
	macintosh:>0x406          beldate-0x7C25B080      >0              last backup: %s,
    filesystems:>>>>>>>>&0    bedate                  =0              full dump
    filesystems:>>>>>>>>&0    bedate                  !0              incremental since: %s

- "offset" in the regex type, does it mean lines or bytes?

- implement the search type

- does the ID3 types mean the ID3 audio?   guess so 

- may need to hand process the lines and split by [ \t] but handle "\ " as non-breaking in the test section

- need to handle the complex offset types:
     Offsets do not need to be constant, but can also be read from the file being examined.  If the first character following the
     last > is a ( then the string after the parenthesis is interpreted as an indirect offset.  That means that the number after
     the parenthesis is used as an offset in the file.  The value at that offset is read, and is used again as an offset in the
     file.  Indirect offsets are of the form: ((x [.[bislBISL]][+-][ y ]).  The value of x is used as an offset in the file.  A
     byte, id3 length, short or long is read at that offset depending on the [bislBISLm] type specifier.  The capitalized types
     interpret the number as a big endian value, whereas the small letter versions interpret the number as a little endian value;
     the m type interprets the number as a middle endian (PDP-11) value.  To that number the value of y is added and the result
     is used as an offset in the file.  The default type if one is not specified is long.

- compile the magic file into a serialized compressed file for size reasons
