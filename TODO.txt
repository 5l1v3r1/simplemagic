- Need to handle:
	macintosh:>0x402          beldate-0x7C25B080      x               created: %s,
	macintosh:>0x406          beldate-0x7C25B080      >0              last backup: %s,
    filesystems:>>>>>>>>&0    bedate                  =0              full dump
    filesystems:>>>>>>>>&0    bedate                  !0              incremental since: %s

- "offset" in the regex type, does it mean lines or bytes?

- implement the search type

- does the ID3 types mean the ID3 audio?   guess so 

- may need to hand process the lines and split by [ \t] but handle "\ " as non-breaking in the test section
