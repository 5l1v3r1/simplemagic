===================================================
Used to maintain requested features or future work.
===================================================

- "offset" in the regex type, does it mean lines or bytes?
- maybe compile the magic file into a serialized compressed file for size reasons?
	- at least pre-process it to normalize whitespace
- need to handle the indirect type?
- is the quad date in seconds or millis?? find a magic that uses them
- need to support the &( (& and the &(& constructs, I don't understand the man pages on it yet even

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speed improvements:

- categorize the file as ~ascii or not, only run the search and regex on the ascii files
	- maybe process the file by lines and search each rule instead of having each rule search the file
