	* Renamed some of the external classes and methods to make more sense.  Hopefully stable now.
	* Refactored some of the code internals.
	* Improved some of the javadocs after walked them.
	* Fixed some old references to Simple JMX that I copied the docs from.

0.1: 05/06/2013
	* Initial public release.  Tweaked javadocs and the like.
